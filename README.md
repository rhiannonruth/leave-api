# LEAVE. API
LEAVE. API is an API that receives JSON containing a start station, end station and arrival time and returns a time to leave.

## Rails Backend

Rails is configured as an API that receives RESTful calls from the Ionic front end application (see [LEAVE.](https://github.com/rhiannonruth/leave)).
